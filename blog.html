        My interest in software engineering came later in life than most people, I think. I started at the age of 28 after having had a career in software sales for about 5 years. 
        It was fun, and there were many rewarding aspects to the role, however, I lacked passion for it.

         The economic impact of the 2020 pandemic had forced my company into a massive layoff, and I had found myself unemployed shortly after finding a sales role I 
         was very excited about. I had been laid off in the past before, but this time I wasn't eager to jump back into the job market and find another sales job. Instead, I had recalled 
         a previous promise I had made to myself a few years ago: "If sales doesn't work out for me again, why not try something else?"

        While selling the software of companies was entertaining, something about creating it seemed to really excite me. I've always been a lazy person, and I think that the one thing that drew
         me to technology was that it typically made life easier. Tasks that I often considered tedious could become simple. A long drawn out process could become efficient. Failing businesses could 
         look to a digital solution and turn their business around.

         Although we may not have the answer to everything yet, it became clear that I wanted to become somebody who had the skills to look for and build those answers. 
         So I decided to take a leap of faith in order to leave a mark that I'm passionate about: building things that make peoples' lives easier.
